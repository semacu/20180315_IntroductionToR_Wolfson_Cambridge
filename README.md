This short course is based on the [R crash course](https://github.com/bioinformatics-core-shared-training/r-crash-course) developed by [Mark Dunning](https://github.com/markdunning) and [Laurent Gatto](https://github.com/lgatto).



### Motivation

- R is one of the most widely-used programming languages for data analysis, statistics and visualisation in academia and industry.
- It is open-source and available in all platforms (Mac, Linux and Windows)
- Supported by a broad community of software developers and researchers who contribute R packages and libraries to many fields of research 
- It facilitates reproducibility in research and integration of all your analyses in individual scripts
- Easy to write documentation and code together using a free environment like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

E.g. The New Zealand [Tourism Dashboard](https://mbienz.shinyapps.io/tourism_dashboard_prod/) uses R extensively to report statistics.



### Installing R and RStudio

- [Latest version of R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    - To check if you have R installed in Mac, go to `Finder` -> `Applications` -> `Utilities` -> `Terminal`, type `R` and press Enter. If you see information about the R version and other details appearing followed by a ">" prompt, then you have R installed.
- [RStudio Desktop Open Source License](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
    - To check if you have RStudio installed in Mac, try opening it, go to `Finder` -> `Applications` and click on `Rstudio` 



### How can I find help?

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- The Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/))
- [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)
- [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
- [Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net/)
- Local R groups, e.g. [R-ladies Cambridge](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-cambridge/)
- Type `?` followed my the name of the function that you'd like to use, e.g. `?mean`

If you are interested in bioinformatics and computational biology, the following links might also be of interest:

- [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/)
- [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/)



### Getting started

- Open RStudio - see above. Explore the different panels

To download today's workshop:

- Go to your web browser and type: https://tinyurl.com/2018-IntroR-Wolfson
- Click on `IntroR.zip`, then press `Download` and save the file in your preferred folder, e.g. your Desktop
- Go to the folder where you saved `IntroR.zip` and uncompress it, e.g. in Mac just double-click on `IntroR.zip`. Only then, the folder `IntroR` will appear.
- The folder `IntroR` contains two files:
    - `IntroR.Rmd` - the code for today's session
    - `patient-data-cleaned.csv` - the dataset that we will be exploring

Now, go back to RStudio:

- Click on `File` -> `Open File` and select `IntroR.Rmd`
- You are all set to go now :)

Also:

- We will be using RStudio console (bottom-left panel) to interact with R during the workshop
- The blocks of code shown in `IntroR.Rmd` - see below - are written using the format **R markdown**, which allows mixed plain text and R code together within the same [document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
- Each line of R code inside a block can be executed by clicking on the line and pressing CMD + ENTER (Mac) or CTRL + ENTER (Windows and Linux), e.g.:

```{r eval=FALSE}
print("R is fun!")
```

Alternatively, to execute the entire block, click on the green arrow tip on the right-hand side of the block.

```{r eval=FALSE}
3 + 1
```

- You can add a new block of code by selecting `R` in the `Insert` menu or by typing the following syntax directly:

```{r}
# R code goes in here
```



### Variables and functions

You can use R as a calculator using the symbols `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`, or more advanced features such as statistical operations, logarithms, trigonometry ...

```{r eval=FALSE}
2 + 1
7 - 1
3 * 2
10 / 5

mean(1:5)
log(1)
pi
sin(pi/2)
```

To store your results for later, use **variables**. To create them, use the assignment operator `<-`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- 25
x
y <- 16
y
```

You can perform multiple operations using variables:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sqrt(x)
x + y
x <- 36
x <- y
x <- x + 8
```

**Functions** in R take one or more *arguments* as input, which are captured using parentheses. Arguments can be named explicitly, otherwise they are meant to be used in the same order as described in the function definition. E.g. `seq` is a function for generating a numeric sequence *from* and *to* particular numbers. Type `?seq` to get the help page for this function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
?seq
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2)
seq(1, 10, 2)
```

Some functions have *default* values in some arguments:

```{r eval=FALSE}
seq(1, 10, 1)
seq(1, 10)
```

The default value for the `by` argument in the `seq()` function is 1.

An alternative method to obtain sequences of numbers spaced by one value is the `:` symbol:

```{r eval=FALSE}
z <- 1:5
z
```



#### Exercise 1

Work in pairs, meet the person sitting next to you and try the following together (3 min):

- Create a sequence of numbers from 10 to 30 spaced by three values
- How about decreasing sequences? Now try from 30 to 10 spaced by three values  (hint: check `?seq`)
- Round the number `pi` down to 1 decimal place (hint: check `?round`)

```{r}


```



### Vectors

- The output we get using R functions such as `seq()` are called vectors, which are collections of numbers or characters
- To create vectors use the function `c()` (a.k.a. *combine*)
- Use square brackets `[ ]` to indicate the position within the vector (the ***index***) and extract elements

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- c(5,6,7,8,9,10)
x
x[3]
x[1]
x[3:5]
```

Arithmetic operations in vectors occur element by element:

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- c(2, 4, 5, 6, 7)
y <- x*2
y
x + y
```

A vector can also contain text, however unlike values, these need to be captured using quotation marks `" "`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- c("a", "b", "b", "c", "c", "d")
x

x <- c(a, b, b, c, c, d) # otherwise R thinks they are objects
```

To create subsets of our vectors, we can use *comparison* operators:

- `==` equal
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `!=` not equal

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- c("a", "b", "b", "c", "c", "d")
x == "b" # this is known as a logical or boolean vector, composed of TRUE or FALSE values only
x != "b"
x[x != "b"]

x <- c(2, 4, 5, 6, 7)
x > 4
x[x > 4]
```



### Import and explore data

We will use a small made-up dataset which is often used for [training purposes](https://www.rpubs.com/Shoaib29/323077). It contains information about 100 lung cancer patients aged 42-44 from different states in the US. We have saved these data as a `.csv` file to demonstrate how to import and explore data using R.

You will first need to find the **path** to the file `patient-data-cleaned.csv`, which was downloaded together with the course materials - see folder `IntroR`. Use the function `file.choose()` to open a dialogue box and browse through the directories to reach the file. The path will then be displayed in R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
file.choose()
```

e.g. for me the path is `/Users/martin03/Desktop/IntroR/patient-data-cleaned.csv`. The file `patient-data-cleaned.csv` is a comma-separated values (CSV) file, which can easily be opened using software like Excel. In R, use the `read.csv()` function and the path obtained above to create a data frame object:

```{r eval=FALSE}
patient_data <- read.csv("/Users/martin03/Desktop/IntroR/patient-data-cleaned.csv") # copy here the path obtained when running file.choose()
```

Exploring rows and columns in the `patient_data` data frame:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Dimensions
dim(patient_data)
ncol(patient_data)
nrow(patient_data)

# Viewing contents
head(patient_data)
View(patient_data)

# Names of columns
colnames(patient_data)

# Accessing data using column names
patient_data$Smokes
patient_data$Height
patient_data$State

# Summary of all data frame contents
summary(patient_data)
```

R works such that the values in each column have all to be of the same type (i.e. all numbers or all characters/text).

You can apply functions to the columns of the data frame to ask various questions:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# What is the maximum height?
max(patient_data$Height)
# What is the minimum weight?
min(patient_data$Weight)
# What is the mean body mass index (BMI)? Rounded to one decimal place?
round(min(patient_data$BMI), 1)
```


#### Subsetting

Just like when subsetting vectors, a selection of a data frame can be made using square brackes `[ , ]`, however data frames are two-dimensional objects so you'll need both *row* and *column* indexes:

```{r eval=FALSE}
patient_data[1 , 2]
patient_data[2 , 1]
patient_data[c(1,2,3) , 1]
patient_data[c(1,2,3) , c(1,2)]
```

If you'd like to see all the rows, or all the columns, you can neglect either the row or column index respectively. But ... remember to keep the comma ;)

```{r eval=FALSE}
patient_data[2, ]
patient_data[, 2]
patient_data[, 1:4]
```

Rather than selecting rows based on indexes, you can also use **comparison** operators to give either a `TRUE` or `FALSE` result. When applied to subsetting, only rows with a `TRUE` result get returned.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# The vector of TRUE or FALSE results applied to subsetting data
patient_data$Height > 183

# Which patients are taller than 183cm?
patient_data[patient_data$Height > 183,]

# Which patients are smokers?
patient_data[patient_data$Smokes == "Smoker",]

# Which patients are taller than 183cm AND are smokers too?
patient_data$Height > 183 & patient_data$Smokes == "Smoker"
patient_data[patient_data$Height > 183 & patient_data$Smokes == "Smoker",]

# You can also select only specific columns using the column name, e.g. give me only the ID, Name, State and Disease Grade
patient_data[patient_data$Height > 183 & patient_data$Smokes == "Smoker", c("ID", "Name", "State", "Grade")]
```

The useful subsetting operators to bear in mind here are **and** `&`, **or** `|` and **in** `%in%`.


#### Exercise 2

Work in pairs if possible (3 min):

- Select patients that have a BMI greater than 30 or their weight is greater than 90kg. Calculate their average height.

- Select female patients from California who are not overweighted

```{r}


```



### Sort tables and export results

The function `order()` gives sorted indices, which can then be used to sort your data set:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Sort patients by Disease Grade
order(patient_data$Grade)
patient_data[order(patient_data$Grade),] # from benign (1) to harmful (3)
patient_data[order(patient_data$Grade, decreasing = TRUE),] # from harmful (3) to benign (1)

# Sort patients by more than one condition: first Disease Grade, second Weight
patient_data[order(patient_data$Grade, patient_data$Weight, decreasing = TRUE),]
```

Once data processing is completed, you can export results out of R as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Which patients from California are non-smokers?
patient_data_california <- patient_data[patient_data$State == "California" & patient_data$Smokes == "Non-Smoker",]

# Export
write.csv(patient_data_california, file = "/Users/martin03/Desktop/IntroR/patient-data-cleaned-california.csv")
```



### Basic plotting

Simple plotting functions are available in the base R distribution (histograms, barplots, boxplots, scatterplots ...). All that is required as input are vectors of data, e.g. columns in your data frame.

**Histograms** are often used to have an overview of the distribution of continuous data:

```{r eval=FALSE}
hist(patient_data$BMI)
hist(patient_data$Weight)
```

**Barplots** are useful when you have counts of categorical data:

```{r eval=FALSE}
barplot(table(patient_data$Race))
barplot(table(patient_data$Sex))
barplot(table(patient_data$Smokes))
barplot(table(patient_data$State), las=2, cex.names=0.7) # 'las=2' changes the x-axis labels to horizonal and 'cex.names=0.7' changes the size
barplot(table(patient_data$Grade))
barplot(table(patient_data$Overweight))
```

**Boxplots** are good when comparing distributions Here the `~` symbol sets up a formula, the effect of which is to put the categorical variable on the x-axis and continuous variable on the y-axis -> `boxplot(y ~ x)`

```{r eval=FALSE}
boxplot(patient_data$BMI ~ patient_data$Grade)

boxplot(patient_data$BMI ~ patient_data$Overweight)
boxplot(patient_data$Weight ~ patient_data$Overweight)
```

**Scatter plots** are useful when representing two continuous variables. Here -> `plot(x, y)`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(patient_data$Weight, patient_data$BMI)
```

To enhance the appearance of your plots, many different ways of customisation are possible:

- **Colours**: `col` argument. To get a full list of possible colours type `colours()`, or check this [online reference](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf).
- **Point type**: `pch`
- **Axis labels**: `xlab` and `ylab`
- **Plot title**: `main`
- ... and many others: see `?plot` and `?par` for more options

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(patient_data$Weight, patient_data$BMI, col="red", pch=16, xlab="Weight (kg)", ylab="BMI", main="US patient data")
abline(lm(patient_data$BMI ~ patient_data$Weight), col="blue")
```

Related arguments can be used for other plotting functions:

```{r eval=FALSE}
boxplot(patient_data$BMI ~ patient_data$Overweight, col=c("red", "green"), xlab="Overweight patient?", ylab="BMI", main="US patient data")
```

To explore other types of plots, have a look [here](https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/index.html). There are dedicated R libraries e.g. [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html) to do more sophisticated plotting. We will be exploring these in future workshops.


#### Export graphics

When running commands directly in the interactive console (bottom-left panel), plots can be exported using the **Plots** tab in RStudio (bottom-right panel). Click on `Export` -> `Save as PDF ...`.

You can also save plots to a file calling the `pdf()` or `png()` functions before executing the code to create the plot:
 
```{r eval=FALSE}
pdf("/Users/martin03/Desktop/IntroR/BMIvsWeight.pdf")
plot(patient_data$Weight, patient_data$BMI, col="red", pch=16, xlab="Weight (kg)", ylab="BMI", main="US patient data")
abline(lm(patient_data$BMI ~ patient_data$Weight), col="blue")
dev.off()
```

The `dev.off()` line is important; without it you will not be able to view the plot you have created.


#### Exercise 3

The final one:

- Any differences of Weight or BMI between Smokers and Non-Smokers? (hint: try `boxplot`)
- Visualise the relationship between the Height and Weight of the patients

That's it! Enjoy R!
